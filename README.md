Create Streamlit App using chatGPT3 

If you're a developer looking for help with a coding problem, [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is the perfect solution. ChatGPT has quickly become the go-to tool for developers looking to get help with coding problems. Its ability to suggest code snippets and offer guidance on how to solve coding challenges has made it incredibly popular, and it's no surprise that ChatGPT has taken the internet by storm.

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) is a popular open-source Python library that I used to build the app. It makes it easy to create interactive, web-based data applications and allows me to create beautiful, intuitive dashboards and data visualizations that can be shared with others.
